    <li>The video annotation screen should start.
    <li>Follow instructions screen.

</ul>

<h2>How an instructor grades annotations that students make:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Go to the course page.
    <li>Click on "Video Annotations" in the course menu on the left side.
    <li>It shows a list of video annotation activities in the course. Click on the link of the course under the "Submitted" column.

    <li>Click on the "Grade" or "Update" link on the same row as the student's name.
    <li>The page looks like what the student sees, except the instructor also sees a grading form.
        The instructor can enter a score and a feedback. When she click the "Grade" button, the grade is recorded.
    <li>When the instructor goes back to the page with a list of users,
        she can see whose submission is graded, whose is not, and who has not submitted anything.
        She can change a student's grade by clicking the "Update" on the same row as the student's name.
</ul>

<h2>known issues and limitations:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The system does not prevent the user from trying to create an event before a tag. A JavaScript error occurs.
    <li>The system does not prevent the user from entering start/end times outside the playable range.
    <li>YouTube videos take longer to load than others.
    <li>Sometimes, the timeline does not function when the video is stopped.
    <li>The interface assumes the End point is no earlier than the Start point.
        For example, if the user clicks "Start" and then rewind the
    <li>video, the interface will not work properly.
    <li>There is no checking of whether events overlap with each other.
    <li>Students are not prevented from making changes after they have submitted their annotations.
    <li>Instructors are also not prevented from changing the students' submissions.
</ul>
